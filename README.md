========
The purpose of this problem set is to give you practice with test-first programming. 
Given a set of specifications, you will write unit tests that check for compliance with the specifications, 
and then implement code that meets the specifications.

Overview of the pset:
The theme of this problem set is to build a toolbox of methods that can extract information from a set of tweets 
downloaded from Twitter.

Since we are doing test-first programming, your workflow for each method should be (in this order).

  1. Study the specification of the method carefully.
  2. Write JUnit tests for method according to the spec.
  3. Implement the method according to the spec.
  4. Revise your implementation and your test cases until your implementation passes all your tests.
